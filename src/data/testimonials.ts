    message: `I trained for 10 years, 5-6 times per week with no coach, tracking or goals; just max effort everytime. After being in a plateu for years, I sought out a coach who introduced me to the concept of training blocks which fundaementally changed how I structure my training and nutrition. I'm more focused now, I have designated rest periods, and my results are better. Block Bear is the mangament and tracking platform above it all so I can focus on my training.`,
